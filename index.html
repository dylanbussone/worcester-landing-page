                    </header>
                    <p>Hi There!</p>

                    <p>
                        Thank you so much for choosing to stay at our home during your visit to Worcester. This is our
                        second home, where we stay whenever we’re in town, and we hope you love it as much as we do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You’ll have access to the entire first-floor unit, with the exception of the room to the right
                        of the TV. No need to worry—this space is simply where we store our personal belongings.
                    </p>

                    <p>Below, you’ll find some helpful information about your home-away-from-home.</p>

                    <p>
                        If you need assistance during your stay, feel free to text or call me (Sarah) at
                        <a href="tel: (774) 280-2445">(774) 280-2445</a>. I primarily reside on the West Coast and am
                        typically available between 12 PM and 1 AM EST.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For emergencies outside of those hours, you can reach Christine at
                        <a href="tel: (508) 341-6454">(508) 341-6454</a>. Please note that responses may be slower
                        during the middle of the night.

                    <p>
                        This home offers <strong>self-check-in</strong>, and you’re welcome to enter anytime after 4:00
                        PM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please note: Entry before 4:00 PM is not permitted unless we’ve explicitly granted early access.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Check-out is at 11:00 AM</strong>. We have an amazing cleaner, and if you’re able, we’d
                        greatly appreciate it if you could start a load of towels before heading out—it helps make the
                        turnover a little easier for her.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When possible, we’re happy to accommodate early check-in or late check-out requests. Just send
                        us a message at least 24 hours before your arrival or departure so we can check our calendar and
                        see if it’s feasible.

                        There is one designated parking spot—please park directly in front of the flower pots with the
                        purple flowers.

                        For any additional vehicles, street parking in the area is free and generally easy to find, so
                        you should have no trouble securing extra spots if needed.

                    <p>This unit is part of a multifamily house, so you’ll need two codes to access it:</p>

                    <ul>

                            <strong>Front Door (Shared Entry)</strong>: When you approach the first door, you’ll see a
                            silver lock. This provides access to the shared entryway. The code is <strong>1483</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Unit Door (Private Entry)</strong>: Once inside, the unit is directly ahead on your
                            left. Your personalized code will be active during your reservation and will be sent to you
                            by Airbnb the day before your arrival.

                        We have light landscaping service scheduled every other week. Please be sure not to leave any
                        personal items outside when you’re away, as the landscapers will need unobstructed access to the
                        yard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the outdoor temperature exceeds 85°F, we kindly ask that you open the window in the pantry
                        before using the dryer. This helps prevent the fire alarm from being triggered due to excessive
                        heat buildup.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During snowstorms, the city may require that cars be removed from the street. In these cases,
                        other tenants may temporarily park down the driveway. Don’t be alarmed if you see additional
                        cars, but please let me know if any are parked in a way that prevents you from exiting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a snow emergency is declared, I’ll notify you so you can move any street-parked vehicles to
                        avoid being towed. Please note: we are not responsible for any towing fees incurred for parking
                        on the street during a snow emergency. If your car is towed, you can call the city’s 311
                        helpline or the non-emergency line at <a href="tel: (508) 799-8606"> (508) 799-8606</a> for
                        assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Walkways, driveways, and parking areas can become slippery in winter conditions. Please use
                        caution and wear appropriate footwear. While we do our best to clear and treat these areas
                        before and during your stay, weather can change quickly. We may need your help during your
                        visit. A shovel and ice melt are available by the front door in the hallway for your convenience
                    </p>
