                        <br />
                        A welcoming sports bar great for all ages. There‚Äôs plenty of parking, but it‚Äôs also
                        just a 10-minute walk from the house.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Scruffy Murphy‚Äôs</strong>
                        <br />
                        One of my favorite haunts when I‚Äôm in town. They offer nightly specials that are hard
                        to beat, and the vibe is always high-energy and fun.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Sushi Miyazawa</strong>
                        <br />
                        In my opinion, the best sushi in Worcester‚Äîand only a 6-minute walk away! It‚Äôs a cozy
                        BYOB spot with just about 10 seats, so expect a wait if dining in. Luckily, takeout is
                        quick and reliable.

                        <strong>The Sole Proprietor</strong>
                        <br />
                        Worcester‚Äôs go-to for fresh seafood. Insider tip: ask for the lunch menu at
                        dinner‚Äîyou‚Äôll usually get the same great options (like a ¬º lb lobster roll) for a bit
                        less.

                        <br />
                        A Worcester legend. Order it with chili for the full experience. There‚Äôs street
                        parking, but also a lot beside the building if you don‚Äôt find a spot.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Peppercorn‚Äôs Grill</strong>
                        <br />
                        A nostalgic classic for me‚ÄîI‚Äôve been coming here since I was a kid. A go-to dinner
                        spot where you‚Äôre likely to bump into someone you know.

                        years ago. If you‚Äôre into avocado, don‚Äôt miss the avocado smoothie.

                        <br />
                        Another Worcester institution. Grab a beer, catch up with friends, and enjoy the
                        neighborhood vibe. Plenty of parking in the back. Fun fact: my dad proposed to my mom
                        at the bar.

                        whole life‚Äîmy grandparents lived across the street and would give me $5 for a small
                        cheese pizza and expect change. It might cost a bit more now, but it‚Äôs still a gem.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Mezcal</strong>

                        Right around the corner from the house. My husband is a Thai food fan and gives it a
                        big thumbs up.

                        wide variety of beers on tap. One of the highlights is their custom hard seltzer bar,
                        where you can mix and match your own flavors.

                        A bit outside of the city, but well worth the trip. Widely regarded as one of the top
                        breweries in the world, it‚Äôs a must-visit for any craft beer enthusiast.

                        <strong>Courthouse Brewing</strong>
                        <br />
                        A recent discovery on one of my trips home. This family-run brewery offers a great
                        selection in a welcoming space. Right next door is a kombucha brewery, and during the
                        summer, they host a Saturday farmers market that‚Äôs worth checking out.
