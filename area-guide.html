                        <strong>Big Y</strong>
                        <br />
                        A full-service grocery store just a 2-minute drive from the house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Price Chopper</strong>
                        <br />
                        Another great grocery option, about 4 minutes away, known for its excellent bakery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>7-Eleven</strong>
                        <br />
                        Located right across the street, perfect for grabbing everyday essentials quickly and
                        conveniently.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Joey’s Bar & Grill</strong>
                        <br />
                        A welcoming sports bar great for all ages. There’s plenty of parking, but it’s also just a
                        10-minute walk from the house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Scruffy Murphy’s</strong>
                        <br />
                        One of my favorite haunts when I’m in town. They offer nightly specials that are hard to beat,
                        and the vibe is always high-energy and fun.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Sushi Miyazawa</strong>
                        <br />
                        In my opinion, the best sushi in Worcester—and only a 6-minute walk away! It’s a cozy BYOB spot
                        with just about 10 seats, so expect a wait if dining in. Luckily, takeout is quick and reliable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The Sole Proprietor</strong>
                        <br />
                        Worcester’s go-to for fresh seafood. Insider tip: ask for the lunch menu at dinner—you’ll
                        usually get the same great options (like a ¼ lb lobster roll) for a bit less.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Coney Island</strong>
                        <br />
                        A Worcester legend. Order it with chili for the full experience. There’s street parking, but
                        also a lot beside the building if you don’t find a spot.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The Mercantile</strong>
                        <br />
                        A newer addition to the Worcester dining scene that made an instant impression. Great food,
                        amazing service—you really can’t go wrong here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Peppercorn’s Grill</strong>
                        <br />
                        A nostalgic classic for me—I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. A go-to dinner spot where
                        you’re likely to bump into someone you know.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Dalat</strong><br />
                        Serving pho and boba long before it was trendy—my parents even went on dates here 36 years ago.
                        If you’re into avocado, don’t miss the avocado smoothie.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Worcester Public Market</strong>
                        <br />
                        A lively food court with local vendors—perfect for when no one can agree on what to eat. Great
                        energy and options for everyone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The Boynton</strong>
                        <br />
                        Another Worcester institution. Grab a beer, catch up with friends, and enjoy the neighborhood
                        vibe. Plenty of parking in the back. Fun fact: my dad proposed to my mom at the bar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Jason’s Pizza</strong>
                        <br />
                        Your go-to neighborhood pizzeria, just around the corner. I’ve been going here my whole life—my
                        grandparents lived across the street and would give me $5 for a small cheese pizza and expect
                        change. It might cost a bit more now, but it’s still a gem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Mezcal</strong>
                        <br />
                        Classy, modern Mexican cuisine—and the only place I’ll get guac in Worcester.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Thai Corner</strong>
                        <br />
                        Right around the corner from the house. My husband is a Thai food fan and gives it a big thumbs
                        up.
