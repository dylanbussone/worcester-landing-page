                        When you arrive, we recommend taking a quick walk-through of the home. If you notice anything

                    <p>
                        Trash day is Thursday, so you may notice bins or bags placed outside on Wednesday night or
                        Thursday morning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because guest bookings don‚Äôt always align with trash day, we occasionally store some trash in
                        the back hallway until someone can come by to take it out. For this reason, we kindly ask that
                        you avoid using the back hallway unless it‚Äôs an emergency.

                    <p>
                        We have light landscaping service scheduled every other week. Please be sure not to leave any
                        personal items outside when you‚Äôre away, as the landscapers will need unobstructed access to the
                        yard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the outdoor temperature exceeds 85¬∞F, we kindly ask that you open the window in the pantry
                        before using the dryer. This helps prevent the fire alarm from being triggered due to excessive
                        heat buildup.

                    <p>
                        During snowstorms, the city may require that cars be removed from the street. In these cases,
                        other tenants may temporarily park down the driveway. Don‚Äôt be alarmed if you see additional
                        cars, but please let me know if any are parked in a way that prevents you from exiting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a snow emergency is declared, I‚Äôll notify you so you can move any street-parked vehicles to
                        avoid being towed. Please note: we are not responsible for any towing fees incurred for parking
                        on the street during a snow emergency. If your car is towed, you can call the city‚Äôs 311
                        helpline or the non-emergency line at <a href="tel: (508) 799-8606"> (508) 799-8606</a> for
                        assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Walkways, driveways, and parking areas can become slippery in winter conditions. Please use
                        caution and wear appropriate footwear. While we do our best to clear and treat these areas
                        before and during your stay, weather can change quickly. We may need your help during your
                        visit. A shovel and ice melt are available by the front door in the hallway for your
                        convenience.
