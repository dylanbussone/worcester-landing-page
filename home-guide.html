                        We‚Äôve provided a few starter essentials to help you settle in with ease. If you need anything
                        else, both Big Y and Price Chopper are conveniently located within 5 minutes of the house.

                        <strong>Trash</strong>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Trash day is Thursday, so you may notice bins or bags placed outside on Wednesday night or
                        Thursday morning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because guest bookings don‚Äôt always align with trash day, we occasionally store some trash in
                        the back hallway until someone can come by to take it out. For this reason, we kindly ask that
                        you avoid using the back hallway unless it‚Äôs an emergency.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you‚Äôre staying for more than a week and would like to take out your own trash or recycling:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Trash: Yellow bags are located under the sink. Once full, simply place them on the curb for
                            pickup.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Recycling: Use the green bins, which are shared by the whole house and stored on the front
                            porch.
                        </li>
